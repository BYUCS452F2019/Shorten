    <h1>Shorten</h1>
    <h2>Shorten your URLs for fun and profit!</h2>
    <h3>Project description</h3>
<p>We'll be going into business
as a URL shortening company.</p>
<p>People will be able to visit our home page,
enter a long URL,
and we'll respond with a short URL
which they can then share with others.</p>
<p>Paid customers will be able to do the same,
but will be able to provide the short ID
for their URLs.
So long as the short ID has not yet been used by
someone else, we will let them use it.</p>
<p>We will provide usage statistics,
with more detail and better features for paying
customers.</p>
    <h3>Team</h3>
<p>I'm looking for one or two others to join
the team.</p>
    <h3>SQL</h3>
<p>Not sure which relational database to use.
Suggestions welcome!</p>
    <h3>No-SQL</h3>
<p>Leaning towards using a key-value database
once this business becomes so successful that
it outgrows SQL databases.</p>
    <h3>Business</h3>
<p>This will be a two tiered business.</p>
<p>At no charge, anyone may use the service to
shorten a URL.
Click throughs may be limited per day,
and or rate-limited.</p>
<p>We will invite people to pay for the service
if they wish either</p>
<ul>
<li>to define their own short IDs</li>
<li>to have unlmited click throughs</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to quickly implement a "minimum viable product" prototype,
and then seek venture capital to go into production.</p>
    <h3>Legal</h3>
<p>The business will be a Utah LLC.</p>
    <h3>Technical</h3>
<p>Our priorities will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose and reserve a short domain name</li>
<li>Choose an initial SQL database for a prototype</li>
<li>Choose both client-side and server-side programming languages</li>
<li>Implement the MVP</li>
</ol>
